1. The objective of this project is to keep track of the electric vehicle
charging habits for residential users. The app will also keep track of the cost of charging their vehicle through a database calculating the rate of kilowatts per hour. Finally, the app should pull from two apis to estimate how much it would cost to take a trip in the electric vehicle.

2. The users would be electric vehicle owns and people who are curious about the costs of an ev compared the a gas car.

3. The issue is that many people don't know the actual cost of owning an electric vehicle and how owning an electric vehicle would benefit them. With this app, it will provide an estimated fueling cost the the ev and also will so the cost of driving it on certain trips.

4. The files that this project will use will a index.html, main.scss, main.js, bootstrap, vue.js, and a database.

5. As for design, one of the pages will contain a spreadsheet that will show the user's previous charging sessions and it should also contain a graph showing the cost of fueling the car over time. The another page should contain a questionnaire form that will then provide a rough estimate on how much it would cost to charge their car in their area.

6. The data that will be used will be from multiple apis. The first api will be from https://openei.org/wiki/Utility_Rate_Database this api contains the cost per kwh based on the person's zip code. The google map's api https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ to get the distance and elevation information to and trip information. The third api I am considering using is open charge map https://openchargemap.org/site . To get the location of different charging stations if the user doesn't have access to a residential charging station. I will also be using a database to keep track of their charging habits.
